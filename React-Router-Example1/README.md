 # React Router
 React Router provides the declarative way to navigate between different views or pages in a react application. It allows users to switch between views without refreshing or loading the entire page. Dynamic routing is also possible in react Router, which means roues can change based oon the application state or data, making it possible to handle complex navigation scenarios.

 The useNavigate hook enables programmatic navigation, allowing developers to navigate between roues based on certain conditions or actions.
